## Basic Neural Network Architectures

### 1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)

# Create a simple feedforward neural network
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),  # Input layer to first hidden layer
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),                            # Second hidden layer
    Dense(output_dim, activation='softmax')                  # Output layer (classification problem)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Performance Optimization Techniques
### 1. Model Compression
Quantization:

- Convert 32-bit floating-point weights to 8-bit integers
- Significantly reduce model size, accelerate inference

```python
# TensorFlow Lite example
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
quantized_model = converter.convert()
```

Pruning:

- Remove unimportant weights or neurons
- Reduce model size and computational requirements

```python
import tensorflow_model_optimization as tfmot

pruning_schedule = tfmot.sparsity.keras.PolynomialDecay(
    initial_sparsity=0.0, final_sparsity=0.5,
    begin_step=0, end_step=1000
)

pruned_model = tfmot.sparsity.keras.prune_low_magnitude(
    model, pruning_schedule=pruning_schedule
)
```

**Knowledge Distillation:**
- Transfer knowledge from a large "teacher" model to a smaller "student" model
- Reduce model size while maintaining performance

```python

def distillation_loss(y_true, y_pred, teacher_preds, temperature=5.0, alpha=0.1):
    # soft target loss
    soft_targets = tf.nn.softmax(teacher_preds / temperature)
    soft_prob = tf.nn.softmax(y_pred / temperature)
    soft_loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(soft_targets, soft_prob)
    
    # hard target loss
    hard_loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
    
    return alpha * soft_loss * (temperature**2) + (1-alpha) * hard_loss
```

### 2. Training Optimization
Learning Rate Scheduling:

- Dynamically adjust the learning rate to improve convergence speed and performance
- Common strategies: learning rate decay, cyclical learning rate, warm restarts
```python
# LR decay example
initial_learning_rate = 0.1
lr_schedule = tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay(
    initial_learning_rate,
    decay_steps=10000,
    decay_rate=0.96,
    staircase=True
)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=lr_schedule)
```

Batch Normalization:

- Standardize inputs to each layer to accelerate training
- Mitigate internal covariate shift

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Activation('relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

Gradient Accumulation:

- Accumulate gradients over multiple mini-batches before updating the model
- Allows for larger effective batch sizes
```python

# Gradient accumulation custom training loop
@tf.function
def train_step(x, y, accumulation_steps=4):
    # Initialize accumulated gradients
    accumulated_gradients = [tf.zeros_like(var) for var in model.trainable_variables]
    
    # Accumulate gradients over multiple batches
    for i in range(accumulation_steps):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(x[i], training=True)
            loss = loss_fn(y[i], predictions)
        
        # Compute gradients
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        
        # Accumulate gradients
        accumulated_gradients = [acum_grad + grad for acum_grad, grad in zip(accumulated_gradients, gradients)]
    
    # Apply accumulated gradients
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(
        [g / accumulation_steps for g in accumulated_gradients],
        model.trainable_variables
    ))
```

## Common Issues and Solutions
### 1. Overfitting
Symptoms:

- Low training error but high validation/test error
- Model performs well on training data but generalizes poorly
Solutions:

- Data augmentation
- Regularization (L1/L2)
- Dropout
- Early stopping
- Reduce model complexity

```python
# Dropout and L2 regularization example
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.001)),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(32, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.001)),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

early_stopping = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',
    patience=10,
    restore_best_weights=True
)
```

### 2. Gradient Vanishing/Explosion
Symptoms:

- Training stagnation
- Extremely small or large weight updates
- Model does not converge
Solutions:

- Use ReLU and its variants as activation functions
- Batch normalization
- Gradient clipping
- Residual connections
- Proper weight initialization

```python
# Gradient clipping
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(clipvalue=0.5)  # Clip gradient values

# Residual connection example
inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
y = Dense(64)(x)
outputs = Add()([x, y])  # Residual connection
outputs = Activation('relu')(outputs)
```

### 3. Class Imbalance
Symptoms:

- Model biased towards majority class
- Low recall for minority class
Solutions:

- Class weights
- Oversample minority class
- Undersample majority class
- Generate synthetic samples (SMOTE)
- Focal loss

```python
# Class weights example
class_weights = {0: 1.0, 1: 5.0}  # Higher weight for minority class
model.fit(x_train, y_train, class_weight=class_weights)

# Focal loss implementation
def focal_loss(gamma=2., alpha=.25):
    def focal_loss_fixed(y_true, y_pred):
        pt = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true, 1), y_pred, 1-y_pred)
        return -alpha * tf.pow(1. - pt, gamma) * tf.math.log(pt + 1e-8)
    return focal_loss_fixed
```

## Choosing the Right Neural Network
When selecting a neural network architecture, consider:

1. Data Type:
   
   - Images → CNNs
   - Sequential/Time series → RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs
   - Text → Transformers, RNNs, LSTMs
2. Problem Type:
   
   - Classification → FNNs, CNNs
   - Regression → FNNs
   - Generation → GANs, Autoencoders
   - Sequence prediction → RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers
3. Data Size:
   
   - Small datasets → Transfer learning
   - Large datasets → Custom architectures
4. Computational Resources:
   
   - Limited resources → Simpler models (GRUs instead of LSTMs)
   - Ample resources → More complex models (Transformers)
