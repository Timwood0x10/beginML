# Deep Reinforcement Learning Networks
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a machine learning approach that combines deep learning with reinforcement learning, using neural networks to learn optimal decision-making strategies in complex environments. Below I will introduce the fundamental concepts, main algorithms, and application scenarios of deep reinforcement learning.

## 1. Fundamentals of Deep Reinforcement Learning
### 1.1 Basic Concepts of Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves the following key elements:

- Agent: The entity that learns to make decisions
- Environment: The external system the agent interacts with
- State: The current situation of the environment
- Action: Operations the agent can perform
- Reward: Feedback signal from the environment for the agent's behavior
- Policy: The agent's behavioral strategy that determines what action to take in a given state
- Value Function: Predicts future cumulative rewards
- Q-Function: Evaluates the value of taking a specific action in a specific state

### 1.2 Advantages of Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Capable of handling high-dimensional state spaces (e.g., images, speech)
- Can learn complex nonlinear policies
- No need for manual feature engineering
- Can learn end-to-end control policies from raw sensory data

## 2. Main Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
### 2.1 Deep Q-Network (DQN)
DQN combines Q-learning with deep neural networks:

- Uses neural networks to approximate the Q-function
- Introduces Experience Replay mechanism to break sample correlations
- Uses Target Network to stabilize training
- Suitable for discrete action spaces

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from collections import deque
import random

class DQN:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.memory = deque(maxlen=2000)
        self.gamma = 0.95    # Discount factor
        self.epsilon = 1.0   # Exploration rate
        self.epsilon_min = 0.01
        self.epsilon_decay = 0.995
        self.learning_rate = 0.001
        self.model = self._build_model()
        self.target_model = self._build_model()
        self.update_target_model()

    def _build_model(self):
        # Build neural network
        model = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(24, input_dim=self.state_size, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(24, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(self.action_size, activation='linear')
        ])
        model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=self.learning_rate))
        return model

    def update_target_model(self):
        # Update target network
        self.target_model.set_weights(self.model.get_weights())

    def remember(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        # Store experience
        self.memory.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))

    def act(self, state):
        # Choose action (exploration or exploitation)
        if np.random.rand() <= self.epsilon:
            return random.randrange(self.action_size)
        act_values = self.model.predict(state)
        return np.argmax(act_values[0])

    def replay(self, batch_size):
        # Learn from experience replay
        minibatch = random.sample(self.memory, batch_size)
        for state, action, reward, next_state, done in minibatch:
            target = reward
            if not done:
                target = reward + self.gamma * np.amax(self.target_model.predict(next_state)[0])
            target_f = self.model.predict(state)
            target_f[0][action] = target
            self.model.fit(state, target_f, epochs=1, verbose=0)
        if self.epsilon > self.epsilon_min:
            self.epsilon *= self.epsilon_decay
```

        # Calculate advantage function (TD error)
        td_targets = rewards + gamma * next_values
        td_errors = td_targets - values
        
        # Calculate Actor (policy) loss
        action_masks = tf.one_hot(actions, model.action_size)
        log_probs = tf.math.log(tf.reduce_sum(action_probs * action_masks, axis=1))
        actor_loss = -tf.reduce_mean(log_probs * td_errors)
        
        # Calculate Critic (value) loss
        critic_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(td_errors))
