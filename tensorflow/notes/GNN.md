# Graph Neural Networks (GNN)

## 1. Introduction to Graph Neural Networks

Graph Neural Networks are a class of deep learning models specifically designed to handle graph-structured data. Graph data is prevalent in the real world, such as social networks, molecular structures, and knowledge graphs. Traditional deep learning models (like CNNs and RNNs) struggle to directly process graph data due to the following characteristics:

- Irregular topology
- Nodes and edges may have different features
- Variable size and structure of graphs
- Complex dependencies between nodes

Graph Neural Networks can effectively learn patterns and features in graph-structured data through a message-passing mechanism.

## 2. Basic Concepts of Graphs

A graph G can be represented as G = (V, E), where:
- V is the set of nodes
- E is the set of edges

Graphs can be categorized into various types:
- **Undirected/Directed Graphs**: Whether edges have direction
- **Homogeneous/Heterogeneous Graphs**: Whether nodes and edges are of the same type
- **Static/Dynamic Graphs**: Whether the graph structure changes over time
- **Weighted/Unweighted Graphs**: Whether edges have weights

## 3. Basic Principles of Graph Neural Networks

The core idea of GNNs is to update the representation of a central node by aggregating information from its neighboring nodes. The basic steps include:

1. **Message Passing**: Each node collects information from its neighbors
2. **Aggregation**: Aggregate the collected information
3. **Update**: Update the node's representation based on the aggregated information

This process can be iterated multiple times, allowing each node to capture broader structural information.

## 4. Common Graph Neural Network Models

### 4.1 Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)

GCN is one of the most basic graph neural network models, updating node representations using the following formula:

$$
H^{(l+1)} = \sigma(\tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\tilde{A}\tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}H^{(l)}W^{(l)})
$$

Where:
- $H^{(l)}$ is the node feature matrix at layer l
- $\tilde{A} = A + I$ is the adjacency matrix with self-loops added
- $\tilde{D}$ is the degree matrix of $\tilde{A}$
- $W^{(l)}$ is the learnable weight matrix
- $\sigma$ is the non-linear activation function

### 4.2 Graph Attention Networks (GAT)

GAT introduces an attention mechanism, allowing nodes to assign different importance to different neighbors:

$$h_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \alpha_{ij} W^{(l)} h_j^{(l)}\right)$$

Where $\alpha_{ij}$ is the attention coefficient, indicating the importance of node j to node i.

### 4.3 GraphSAGE

GraphSAGE is an inductive learning method capable of handling dynamic graphs and unseen nodes:

$$h_v^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(W^{(l)} \cdot \text{CONCAT}(h_v^{(l)}, \text{AGGREGATE}(\{h_u^{(l)}, \forall u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\}))\right)$$

Where AGGREGATE can be mean, max, or LSTM, etc.

### 4.4 Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)

GIN is theoretically the most expressive GNN model:

$$h_v^{(l+1)} = \text{MLP}^{(l)}\left((1 + \epsilon^{(l)}) \cdot h_v^{(l)} + \sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} h_u^{(l)}\right)$$

Where $\epsilon$ is a learnable or fixed parameter.

## 5. Applications of Graph Neural Networks

GNNs have wide applications in various fields:

### 5.1 Node Classification

Predict the category of nodes in a graph, such as classifying user interests in social networks.

### 5.2 Graph Classification

Predict the category of the entire graph, such as predicting the toxicity of molecules.

### 5.3 Link Prediction

Predict whether there is an edge between two nodes in a graph, such as user-item interaction prediction in recommendation systems.

### 5.4 Community Detection

Identify tightly connected groups of nodes in a graph, such as community discovery in social networks.

### 5.5 Graph Generation

Generate new graphs with specific attributes, such as drug molecule design.

## 6. Challenges of Graph Neural Networks

GNNs still face several challenges:

- **Over-smoothing Problem**: As the number of layers increases, node representations tend to become similar
- **Scalability**: Computational efficiency issues in handling large-scale graph data
- **Dynamic Graphs**: Handling graph structures that change over time
- **Heterogeneous Graphs**: Handling graphs with different types of nodes and edges
- **Interpretability**: Understanding the decision-making process of GNNs

## 7. Implementing GNN with TensorFlow

Below we implement a simple GCN model using TensorFlow and Keras:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, Model
import numpy as np

class GCNLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, activation=None, **kwargs):
        super(GCNLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.activation = activation
        
    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.weight = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[0][-1], self.units),
            initializer='glorot_uniform',
            trainable=True
        )
        self.bias = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units,),
            initializer='zeros',
            trainable=True
        )
        
    def call(self, inputs):
        # inputs: [node_features, adjacency_matrix]
        features, adj = inputs
        
        # Normalize adjacency matrix
        D = tf.reduce_sum(adj, axis=1)
        D = tf.math.pow(D, -0.5)
        D = tf.linalg.diag(D)
        adj_norm = tf.matmul(tf.matmul(D, adj), D)
        
        # Graph convolution operation
        support = tf.matmul(features, self.weight)
        output = tf.matmul(adj_norm, support)
        output = output + self.bias
        
        if self.activation is not None:
            output = self.activation(output)
            
        return output

class GCN(Model):
    def __init__(self, hidden_units, num_classes):
        super(GCN, self).__init__()
        self.gcn1 = GCNLayer(hidden_units, activation=tf.nn.relu)
        self.gcn2 = GCNLayer(num_classes)
        self.dropout = layers.Dropout(0.5)
        
    def call(self, inputs, training=False):
        x = self.gcn1(inputs)
        x = self.dropout(x, training=training)
        x = self.gcn2([x, inputs[1]])
        return x

# Example: Construct a simple graph
# Assume there are 5 nodes, each with 3 features
node_features = np.random.randn(5, 3).astype(np.float32)

# Adjacency matrix (including self-loops)
adjacency_matrix = np.array([
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
], dtype=np.float32)

# Create GCN model
model = GCN(hidden_units=16, num_classes=2)

# Forward pass
outputs = model([node_features, adjacency_matrix], training=True)
print(outputs.shape)  # Output: (5, 2), representing 2-class predictions for 5 nodes
